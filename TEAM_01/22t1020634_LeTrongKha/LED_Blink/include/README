This directory is intended for project header files.

A header file is a file containing C declarations and macro definitions
to be shared between several project source files. You request the use of a
header file in your project source file (C, C++, etc) located in `src` folder
by including it, with the C preprocessing directive `#include`.

```src/main.c

#include "header.h"

int main (void)
{
 ...
}
```

Including a header file produces the same results as copying the header file
into each source file that uses it. Such copying would be time-consuming
and error-prone. With the include mechanism, a single copy of the header
file manages all uses. The preprocessing directive `#include` causes the
preprocessor to replace that directive with the entire contents of the
header file.

There are two types of header files: the files that the programmer writes
and the files that comes with your compiler.

You request to use a header file in your project by including it, with
the C preprocessing directive `#include`.

All the header files (.h) should be placed in the `include` directory.
